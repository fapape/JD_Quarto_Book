## Installation Procedure

The installation procedure is detailed in [this tutorial](https://github.com/TanguyBarthelemy/JD-Tutorials/blob/master/Sheets/Sheet_1_Tools_installation_EN.md).

This tutorial allows you to install the tools (GUI and R packages) in version&nbsp;2 and in version&nbsp;3.


###  Launching JDemetra+

To open an application, double click on *nbdemetra.exe* or *nbdemetra64.exe* depending on the system version (*nbdemetra.exe* for the 32-bit system version and *nbdemetra64.exe* for the 64-bit system version).

![**Launching JDemetra+**](All_images/RunningJDemetra.jpg)

If the launching of JDemetra+ fails, you can try the following operations:

- Check if Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) is properly installed by typing in the following command in a terminal: 

```
java --version
```

- Check the logs in your home directory:

    + [%appdata%/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/]{.path} for Windows;

    + [~/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/]{.path}` for Linux and Solaris;

    + [~/Library/Application Support/.nbdemetra/dev/var/log/]{.path} for Mac OS X.

In order to remove a previously installed JDemetra+ version, the user should delete an appropriate JDemetra+ folder.

[**JDemetra+ default window**]{.figure-caption}

:::


::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}

![**JDemetra+ default window**](All_images/Jd_mainwindow.png)

:::

By default, on the left hand side of the window two panels are visible:

- The [*Workspace* panel](#workspace-window) stores the results generated by the software as well as settings used to create them;
- The [*Providers* panel](#providers-window) organises the imported raw data within each data provider;

The other key parts of the user interface are:

- The [application menu](#topbar-menu).
- A central empty zone for presenting the actual analyses further called the [Results panel](#results-panel-overview).



## Providers window {#providers-window}

![**The *Providers* window**](All_images/A_Ref5.jpg){.image}

By default, JDemetra+ supports the following data sources:

- JDBC;
- ODBC;
- SDMX;
- Excel spreadsheets;
- TSW (input files for the [TRAMO-SEATS-Windows application](https://www.bde.es/bde/en/secciones/servicios/Profesionales/Programas_estadi/Programas.html) by the Bank of Spain);
- TXT;
- USCB (input files for the [X-13-ARIMA-SEATS application](https://www.census.gov/srd/www/winx13/) by the U.S. Census Bureau);
- XML.

All standard databases (Oracle, SQLServer, DB2, MySQL) are supported by JDemetra+ via JDBC, which is a generic interface to many relational databases. Other providers can be added by users by creating plugins (see *Plugins* section in the [Tools](tools.html) menu).


### Import data {#import-data}

To import data from a given data source:

- click on this data source in the *Providers* window shown below
- choose *Open* option and specify the import details, such as a path to a data file. 

These details vary according to data providers.

![**An example of importing process for the Excel file :**](All_images/Import_spreadsheet.gif)

::: 

The example below show how to import the data from an Excel file.

1.  From the *Providers* window **right-click** on the *Spreadsheets* branch and choose *Open* option.

    ![**Data provider available by default**](All_images/Aimage6.jpeg)

2.  The *Open data source* window contains the following options:

    + **Spreadsheet file** -- a path to access the Excel file.

    + **Data format** (or **Observartion format** in v3) -- the data format used to read dates and values. It includes three fields: *locale* (country), *date pattern* (data format, e.g. *yyyy-mm-dd*), *number pattern* (a metaformat of numeric value, e.g. 0.## represents two digit number).

    + **Frequency** -- time series frequency. This can be undefined, yearly, half-yearly, four-monthly, quarterly, bi-monthly, or monthly. When the frequency is set to undefined, JDemetra+ determines the time series frequency by analysing the sequence of dates in the file.

    + **Aggregation type** -- the type of aggregation (over time for each time series in the dataset) for the imported time series. This can be *None*, *Sum*, *Average*, *First*, *Last*, *Min* or *Max*. The aggregation can be performed only if the *frequency* parameter is specified. For example, when frequency is set to *Quarterly* and aggregation type is set to *Average*, a monthly time series is transformed to quarterly one with values that are equal to the one third of the sum of the monthly values that belong to the corresponding calendar quarter.

    + **Clean missing** <a id="clean-missing"></a> -- erases missing values at the start of the series.

    Next, in the *Source* section click the grey "..." button to open the file.

    ![**Data source window**](All_images/Aimage7.jpeg)

3.  Choose a file and click *OK*.

    ![**Choice of an Excel spreadsheet**](All_images/Aimage8.jpeg)

4.  The user may specify *Data format*, *Frequency* and *Aggregation type*, however this step is not compulsory. When these options are specified JDemetra+ is able to convert the time series frequency. Otherwise, the functionality that enables the time series frequency to be converted will not be available.

    ![**Options for importing data**](All_images/Aimage9.jpeg)

5.  The data are organized in a tree structure.

    + **Charset** -- the encoding used to encode the file
    
    + **Lines to skip** -- the number of lines to skip before reading the data
    
    + **Delimiter** -- the character used to separate fields in the file
    
    + **Text qualifier** -- the characters used to retrieve text fileds
    
    + **Has header** -- check tu use the first line as header
    
    + **Data format** (or **Observartion format** in v3) -- the data format used to read dates and values. It includes three fields: *locale* (country), *date pattern* (data format, e.g. *yyyy-mm-dd*), *number pattern* (a metaformat of numeric value, e.g. 0.## represents two digit number).

    + **Frequency** -- time series frequency. This can be undefined, yearly, half-yearly, four-monthly, quarterly, bi-monthly, or monthly. When the frequency is set to undefined, JDemetra+ determines the time series frequency by analysing the sequence of dates in the file.

    + **Aggregation type** -- the type of aggregation (over time for each time series in the dataset) for the imported time series. This can be *None*, *Sum*, *Average*, *First*, *Last*, *Min* or *Max*. The aggregation can be performed only if the *frequency* parameter is specified. For example, when frequency is set to *Quarterly* and aggregation type is set to *Average*, a monthly time series is transformed to quarterly one with values that are equal to the one third of the sum of the monthly values that belong to the corresponding calendar quarter.

    + **Clean missing** -- erases the missing values of the series.
    
    + **Partial aggregation** -- Allow partial aggregation (only with average and sum aggregation).

    Next, in the *Source* section click the grey "..." button to open the file.

### Wrangling data

Series uploaded to the *Providers* window can be 

- [Displayed](#container), 
- Modified
- Tested for seasonality / white noise

or used in any available algorithm (link to list)

- Modelled Modelling
- Seasonnally adjusted 
- Benchmarked



### Behaviour options 

#### Restoring data sources

The data sources can be restored after re-starting the application so that there is no need to get them again. This functionality can be set in the *Behaviour* tab available at the [*Option*](#options-window) item from the [*Tools*](#tools-menu) menu.

#### Add Star

You can also favorite files to find them each time you open the software.

To favorite a file:

- **right-click** on the file
- click on **Add star**

![**Create a new favorite**](All_images/add_star.png)


A favorite file will have a little star on top right of the logo:

![**Example of a favorite file**](All_images/favorite_file.png)


To remove a favorite:

- **right-click** on the file
- click on **Remove star**

![**Remove a favorite**](All_images/remove_star.png)



## Workspace Structure

The workspace is the main data structure used by JDemetra+.

The workspace saved by JDemetra+ includes:

- Main folder containing several folders that correspond to the different types of items created by the user and;

- The `.xml` file that enables the user to import the workspace to the application and to display its content.

![**Example of a workspace created by JDemetra+.**](All_images/A_Ref7.png)

The workspace can be shared with other users, which eases the burden of work with defining specifications, modelling and seasonal adjustment processes.

The main folder contains:

- a folder **SAProcessing** with all the result of the SA
- folders **TramoSeatsSpec** and/or **X13Spec** with the custom specifications
- a folder **Variables** for external regressor and variables
- a folder **Calendars** with the calendars used to correct the trading days effect
- a folder **Output** contains all the generated output from the GUI

![**Structure of a workspace**](All_images/ws_structure.png)




## Workspace window {#workspace-window}

The workspace window displays the **characteristics** of a workspace but ALSO gives access to other peripheric routines, the results of which won't be stored in a workspace (as data structure).

You can find:

- [Modelling](#modelling-window) (contains the default and user-defined specifications for modelling; and the output from the modelling process)

- [Seasonal adjustment](#sa-window) (contains the default and user-defined specifications for seasonal adjustment and the output from the seasonal adjustment process),

- Utilities ([calendars](#usr-def-cal) and [user defined variables](#usr-def-var)).




### Modelling

(I ll rewrite all this)
access to RegArima or Tramo modelling routines 

which are the same as the ones used for the pre-treatment phase of 
seasonal adjustment with X13-ARIMA (Reg-Arima) and TRAMO-SEATS (Tramo) and thus described in the SA chapter.


This section is divided into two parts: 
* [Specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html), which presents parameters of the modelling procedure.
* [Output](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html), which details a typical output produced by the modelling procedure.

The specifications and output of the modelling procedure are displayed in the [*Workspace* window](#workspace-window).

![**The Top bar menus**](All_images/top_bar_menu.png)

:::


The majority of functionalities are available from the main application menu, which is situated at the very top of the main window. If the user moves the cursor to an entry in the main menu and clicks on the left mouse button, a drop-down menu will appear. Clicking on an entry in the drop-down menu selects the highlighted item.

![**The main menu with selected drop-down menu**](All_images/A_Ref10.jpg)


The functions available in the main application menu are:

- [File](#file-menus)
- [Statistical methods](#statistical-methods)
- [View](#view)
- [Tools](#tools-menu)
- [Window](#window-menu)
- [Help](#help-menu)
- [RegArimaDoc](#RegArimaDoc)
- [X-13Doc](#X-13Doc)
- [TramoDoc](#TramoDoc)
- [TramoSeatsDoc](#TramoSeatsDoc)
- [SAProcessingDoc](#SAProcessingDoc)

### File {#file-menus}

The *File* menu is intended for working with [workspaces](#workspace-window) and [data sources](#providers-window). It offers the following functions:

- **New Workspace** -- creates a new workspace and displays it in the *Workspace* window with a default name (*Workspace\_#number*);

- **Open Workspace** -- opens a dialog window, which enables the user to select and open an existing workspace;

- **Open Recent Workspace** -- presents a list of workspaces recently created by the user and enables the user to open one of them;

- **Save Workspace** -- saves the project file named by the system under the default name (*Workspace\_#number*) and in a default location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later time;

- **Save Workspace As...** -- saves the current workspace under the name chosen by the user in the chosen location. The workspace can be re-opened at a later time;

- **Open Recent** -- presents a list of datasets recently used and enables the user to open one of them;

- **Exit** -- closes an application.

![**The content of the *File* menu**](All_images/File menu.jpg)

### Statistical Methods {#statistical-methods}

Here just a hint and link to relevant chapters 

The Statistical methods menu includes functionalities for modelling, analysis and the seasonal adjustment of a time series. They are divided into three groups:

- [Anomaly Detection](#anomaly-detection) -- allows for a purely automatic identification of regression effects;

![**The *Anomaly detection* tab.**](All_images/Statistical methods menu anomaly detection.png)

- [Modelling](#modelling) -- enables time series modelling using the TRAMO and RegARIMA models;

![**The *Modelling* tab.**](All_images/Statistical methods menu modelling.png)

- [Seasonal adjustment](#seasonal-adjustment??) -- intended for the seasonal adjustment of a time series with the TRAMO-SEATS and X-13ARIMA-SEATS methods.

By default, the *Seasonal adjustment* tab has 3 sub-tabs:

- *Multiprocessing*, 
- *Single Analysis*, 
- and *Tools*.

![**The *Seasonal adjustment* tab in v2**](All_images/Statistical methods menu.png)

#### Plugins {#plugins-overview}

Installation an functionalities of plugins are described in the related [chapter](#plugins).


### View {#view}

The View menu contains functionalities that enable the user to modify how JDemetra+ is viewed. It offers the following items:

- **Split** -- the function is not operational in the current version of the software.

- **Toolbars** -- displays selected toolbars under the main menu. The *File* toolbar contains the *Save all* icon. The *Performance* toolbar includes two icons: one to show the performance of the application, the other to stop the application profiling and taking a snapshot. The *Other* toolbar determines the default behaviour of the program when the user double clicks on the data. It may be useful to plot the data, visualise it on a grid, or to perform any pre-specified action, e.g. execute a seasonal adjustment procedure.

- **Show Only Editor** -- displays only the *Results* panel and hides other windows (e.g. *Workspace* and *Providers*).

- **Full Screen** -- displays the current JDemetra+ view in full screen.

![**The *View* menu**](All_images/View menu.jpg)

### Window menu {#window-menu}

The *Window* menu offers several functions that facilitate the analysis of data and enables the user to adjust the interface view to the user's needs.

![**The *Window* menu**](All_images/A_Ref51.jpg)

- **Preview Time Series** -- opens a window that plots any of the series the user selects from *Providers*.

- **Debug** -- opens a *Preview Time Series* window that enables a fast display of the graphs for time series from a large dataset. To display the graph click on the series in the *Providers* window.

- [**Providers**](#providers-window) -- opens (if closed) and activates the *Providers* window.

- [**Variables**](#usr-def-var) -- opens (if closed) and activates the *Variable* window.

- [**Workspace**](#workspace-window) -- opens (if closed) and activates the *Workspace* window.

By default, the *Demetra* panel is shown. It is divided into seven tabs: 

- *Behaviour*, 
- *Demetra UI*, 
- *Statistics*, 
- *Data transfer*, 
- *Demetra Paths*, 
- *ProcDocumentItems*, 
- and *Interchange*.

![**Demetra panel in v2**](All_images/demetra_panel_v2.png)

#### v3

By default, the *Demetra* panel is shown. It is divided into three tabs:: 

- *Common UI*, 
- *Behaviour*, 
- and *Demetra Paths*.

![**Demetra panel in v3**](All_images/demetra_panel_v3.png)

In v3, you will just find three tabs: 

- *Common UI*, 
- *Behaviour*, 
- and *Demetra Paths*.

![**Demetra panel in v3**](All_images/demetra_panel_v3.png)

:::


#### Behaviour tab

![**The content of the *Behavior* tab**](All_images/A_Ref42.jpg)

The tab *Behaviour* defines the default reaction of JDemetra+ to some of the actions performed by the user.

- **Providers** -- an option to show only the data providers that are currently available.

![**The option Providers**](All_images/options_demetra_behaviour_providers.png)


- **Persistence** -- an option to restore the data sources after re-starting the application so that there is no need to fetch them again (**Persist opened DataSources**) and an option to restore all the content of the chart and grid tools (**Persist tools content**).

![**The option Persistence**](All_images/options-demetra-behaviour-persistence.png)


- **Threading** -- defines how resources are allocated to the computation (**Batch Pool Size** controls the number of cores used in parallel computation and **Batch Priority** defines the priority of computation over other processes). Changing these values might improve computation speed but also reduce user interface responsiveness.

![**The option Threading**](All_images/options-demetra-behaviour-threading.png)


- **Time Series** -- determines the default behaviour of the program when the user double clicks on the data. It may be useful to plot the data, visualise it on a grid, or to perform any pre-specified action, e.g. execute a seasonal adjustment procedure.

![**The option Time Series**](All_images/options-demetra-behaviour-timeseries.png)


::: {.callout-note title="Low-level options"}

In v3, the option **Show low-level options** unable the user to access more settings in the specification.

![**Seasonal Adjustment option**](All_images/options-demetra-statistics-seasonnal-adjustment.png)


- The type of the analysis of revision history (**Revision History**):

    + *FreeParameters* -- the RegARIMA model parameters and regression coefficients of the RegARIMA model will be re-estimated each time the end point of the data is changed. This argument is ignored if no RegARIMA model is fit to the series.

    + *Complete* -- the whole RegARIMA model together with regressors will be re-identified and re-estimated each time the end point of the data is changed. This argument is ignored if no RegARIMA model is fitted to the series.

    + *None* -- the ARIMA parameters and regression coefficients of the RegARIMA model will be fixed throughout the analysis at the values estimated from the entire series (or model span).

![**Revision History option in v2**](All_images/options-demetra-statistics-revision_history.png)


- The settings for the quality measures and tests used in a diagnostic procedure:
